*What the scripts do*

The script performs a minimal install of Gentoo with System-D and
GenKernel automatically without any user input once it is executed.

Similarly, Genkernel is used to both avoid manually configuring the
kernel and to narror the points of failure when booting in the system
for the first time. Once the system has been booted successfully,
Genkernel can be replaced with a customized kernel configuration.

There is minimal user input, all customizations are set as shell
variables. These are changed by editing the script directly. Config
files are customized by editing the desired file in teh "Config files"
directory.

*How to get the scritps*

If the iso installer has git, clone the repository at the beginning of
the installation, otherwise clone it onto a USB and then mount it during
installation.

=git clone https://github.com/jholty66/gentoo-insaller=


*How to use the scripts*

- "Partition mounting, formatting and creation" contains scripts that
  configure the partiton table and file systems. Scripts that manage the
  installations are not dependent on these scripts. These scripts can be
  optionally run.

- Scripts in the "Install directory" perform a minimal install of Gentoo
  with System-D and GenKernel.

- Scripts in "Post install" can be optionally run which automate tasks
  such as setting up Xorg.
